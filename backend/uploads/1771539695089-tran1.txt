Project: Website Redesign Sprint Planning

Rahul: Okay everyone, thanks for joining. Let’s finalize the action plan for the website redesign project.

Aisha: The design mockups are almost ready. I’ll share the final version with the team by Friday.

Rahul: Great. Once that’s done, we need to start frontend development immediately.

Meera: I can begin working on the homepage layout as soon as the mockups are approved.

Rahul: Perfect. Meera, please complete the homepage layout by next Wednesday.

Meera: Sure, I’ll deliver it by Wednesday evening.

Aisha: We also need updated product images. Someone should coordinate with the marketing team.

Rahul: Good point. I’ll contact the marketing team tomorrow and request the updated assets.

Karan: What about backend API integration?

Rahul: Karan, can you handle the API integration once the frontend structure is ready?

Karan: Yes, I’ll take care of that. I should be able to finish it within three days after receiving the frontend code.

Aisha: We also need to review SEO optimization before launch.

Rahul: Let’s make that high priority. We cannot delay SEO fixes.

Meera: Should we schedule a review meeting next week?

Rahul: Yes, schedule it for next Monday afternoon.

Aisha: Who will prepare the deployment checklist?

Rahul: That still needs to be decided. We’ll assign it in the next meeting.

Rahul: Alright, to summarize:
- Final design by Friday.
- Homepage layout by Wednesday.
- API integration after frontend.
- Marketing assets request tomorrow.
- SEO optimization high priority.
- Deployment checklist pending assignment.

Rahul: Thanks everyone. Let’s stay on track.
