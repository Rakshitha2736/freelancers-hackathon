Project: Data Migration Planning

Anita: The database migration needs to happen this month.

Vikram: Someone should check compatibility issues with legacy systems.

Anita: Yes, that’s important. We don’t want downtime.

Rahul: I can probably look into compatibility if needed.

Anita: That would be helpful, Rahul.

Vikram: Backup scripts also need updating soon.

Anita: We can’t delay that. It’s critical.

Rahul: Maybe I’ll update the backup scripts this week.

Anita: Let’s aim to complete backup script updates by the 18th.

Vikram: Testing migration in staging environment should happen before production deployment.

Rahul: I think we can test by the 20th.

Anita: Let’s finalize migration date as 25th.

Vikram: Security audit is pending too.

Anita: Good point. Who’s taking security audit?

Rahul: Not sure yet.

Anita: Okay, we’ll assign security audit in the next meeting.

Vikram: Documentation must be updated post-migration.

Anita: Add that to checklist.
